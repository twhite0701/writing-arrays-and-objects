    This drill tests your ability to refactor code to be more terse.

    This code has the same output as the previous drill, `10-array-map-join.html`.

    Write down where the refactorings that have taken place:

    1. Using a template string 
    2. Using an anonymous map function instead of a separate function
    3. Chaining the map and join and so, not creating an unecessary variable.

    Make changes to the below code so that another 5 list items are displayed with the content: "six", "seven", "eight", "nine" and "ten".
  </pre>

  <div class="content">
    <h1>Page with a list</h1>
    <main class="main">
      <ul class="list"></ul>
    </main>
  </div>

<script>
  //i added in numbers 5-9
  const items = ['one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight', 'nine','ten'];


//this function is a combination of the 2 functions from array-map-join
//it uses the second part of the function first, getListItems in example 1. This statement is truncated. So, it is still keeping the items.map().
//insead of items.map(getListItem) (from function 1), this function is directly stating the following:
    //instead of saying, each item in the items array, get the value from getListItem and add it to the listItems array
    //we  are nesting functions to say: first, return `${item}` displayed within <li>List item `${item}`!</li> from the items variable.
    //then, take the value you returned above, and add it to a new anonymous map and join that array together with a space in between.
    //we can use an anonymous map because it is within the same function-- we don't have to call on it from within a separate function.
//we've used a template literal within the li string so we can call as many numbers as we would like and add them to the array.
  function getListItems() {
    return items.map(function (item) {
      return `<li>List item ${item}!</li>`;
    }).join('');
  }

//this method remains to same because the single function gives us the same answer as the previous 2 functions.
  document.querySelector('.list').innerHTML = getListItems();
</script>
</body>
