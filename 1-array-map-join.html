    This drill tests your ability to under the array map and join pattern to produce HTML on a page.

    Predict the outcome of this code below and add comments that describe what is happening.

    Can you change the contents of the items to count to 5 in german?
  
  </pre>

  <div class="content">
    <h1>Page with a list</h1>
    <main class="main">
      <ul class="list"></ul>
    </main>
  </div>

<script>
//testing the array.map() with join() to produce HTML
//predict outcome of the code below and describe what is happening
//change the contents of the items to count to 5 in german

//this is an array which give us a way to store the same kind of information about multiple things:
  const items = ['one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five'];

//this is a function called getListItem which is a reusable set of instructions
//it has one parameter = item 
//this function will return "<li>List item [item]!</li>" when called upon. The [item] will get replaced by the property that is calling it
  function getListItem(item) {
    return '<li>List item ' + item + '!</li>';
  }

//this function is declaring a new array called listItems and telling that variable to use the method .map
// the const line is saying for each item in the items array, get the value from getListItem and add it to the listItems array
// the return line is saying take the new listItems array and join them all in one line with a space in between each token
  function getListItems() {
    const listItems = items.map(getListItem);
    return listItems.join('');
  }

//this method allows us to change the HTML via javascript in the <script> tag.
// were telling this method to find the class named 'list' (the ul class from above) and change the HTML (tags & text) inside of it to our getListItems function (the 2nd function).
  document.querySelector('.list').innerHTML = getListItems();

  //predicted outcome: <ul class="list">
                          //<li>List item one!</li>
                         // <li>List item two!</li>
                          //<li>List item three!</li>
                          //<li>List item four!</li>
                         // <li>List item five!</li>
                        // </ul>


//Can you change the contents of the items to count to 5 in german?
        //from my google searches, it seems like I would have to load in a translation source file in order to count the items in german.
